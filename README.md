# ES6Samples

This repository holds the code for [es6samples.com](http://es6samples.com), which aims to provide step-by-step samples from the most basic to the most complex features found in the latest finalized version of ECMAScript 262 (read: JavaScript!), with a goal of covering most of the many different scenarios presented in the specification.

The site is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and as such follows the standard Jekyll directory structure with the different sample pages being in the `_posts` directory and so on.

## Contributing
