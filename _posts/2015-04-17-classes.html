    <h1>Classes</h1>

Classes were added in ES6 to ease JavaScript's prototypical inheritance,
and support typical object-oriented concepts such as inheritance, super
calls, instance & static methods, and constructors.

On line 1, we define a `Vehicle` class using the `class` keyword. Using the required
naming convention of `constructor`, a constructor for our class is defined on lines 2-5,
where we take a single argument passed to set the `kind` instance property, as well as
a default `position` property.

To define an instance method, we simply type the method signature of a `move`
method, setting the `position` property with the single argument.

  <div class="code">

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
class Vehicle {
  constructor (kind) {
    this.kind = kind;
    this.position = [0, 0, 0];
  }

  move(position) {
    this.position = position;
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Line 1 defines a `Car` class that extends the `Vehicle` class. Using the same
constructor format, we can call the parent class' constructor using `super()`, passing
in any arguments (in this case, the kind of vehicle).

Static methods can be defined by prepending the method signature with the
`static` keyword, as on line 8.

To override a parent class' method, define the method as you would normally. The
parent's overriden method can be called using `super.methodName()`, as on line 13,
and this even works for overriden static methods.

In order to create an instance of our class, it must be called using the `new`
keyword. On line 17, we create a new car, passing it a name of "Mini Cooper" and
calling it's move method, which will call `Vehicle#move`.

    super('Car');

  static transportType() {
    return 'ground';
  }

  move(x, y) {
    super.move([x, y, 0]); // Cars move along a 2D plane
  }
}

var miniCooper = new Car('Mini Cooper');
var ford = Car('Ford'); // => TypeError!

miniCooper.move(3, 5); // => this.position === [3, 5, 0];
