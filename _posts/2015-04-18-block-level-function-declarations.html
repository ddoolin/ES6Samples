On a more esoteric note, `ES6` is fixing a long standing issue with block scope function definitions. In ES6 function declarations are block-scoped.

In particular, ES6 supports `block-level functions`, so the example code should produce the error “doSomething is not defined”.

Block level functions are hoisted to the top of the block in which they are defined, so `typeof doSomething` returns `function` even though it appears before the function declaration in the code. Once the if block is finished executing, doSomething() no longer exists.

doSomething();  //doSomething is not defined
