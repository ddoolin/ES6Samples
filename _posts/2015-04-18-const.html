A sibling to `let` is `const`. let and const behave similarly in the sense that both are `block scoped`, but with const, the values are `read-only` and cannot be re-declared later on. As the name implies, const has a constant binding and thus replacing its value has no effect. 

const must have an `initialiser`, unlike let and var declarations.

A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope.

The major use case for const is to safeguard important constants from being overwritten accidentally.

Note that const does not affect whether the value of a constant itself is `mutable` or not: If a constant refers to an object, it will always refer to that object, but the object itself can still be changed (if it is mutable).

const z;      // SyntaxError: const declarations must have an initializer
const y = 10; // y === 10
y = 20;       // SyntaxError: Assignment to constant variable

// const also works on objects
const obj = {};

// Overwriting the object fails   
obj = {};     // TypeError

// However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems
obj.prop = 123;
console.log(obj.prop);     // 123
